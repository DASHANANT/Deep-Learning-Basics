Perceptron
---
Perceptron is a single layer neural network and a multi-layer perceptron is called Neural Networks.
Perceptron is a linear classifier (binary). Also, it is used in supervised learning. It helps to classify the given input data.

How does it work?
------------
The perceptron works on these simple steps
-----------------------

- a. All the inputs x are multiplied with their weights w. Letâ€™s call it k.

-----------------------



- b. Add all the multiplied values and call them Weighted Sum.

-----------------------



- c. Apply that weighted sum to the correct Activation Function.
For Example: Unit Step Activation Function.

Why do we need Weights and Bias?
----
Weights shows the strength of the particular node.
A bias value allows you to shift the activation function curve up or down.

Why do we need Activation Function?
----
In short, the activation functions are used to map the input between the required values like (0, 1) or (-1, 1).
